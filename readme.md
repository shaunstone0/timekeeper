## TimeKeeper Application

# This Project has been Discontinued, and will be built better and stronger using the skills that I have learned since building it! But it does give a reference from where I was, to where I am now!

> An application for Human Resources to keep track of employee working times. I wanted to create an application that would give feedback to employees and HR.

**This application was built by me, in part with tutorials from Brad Traversy. give him some love and suppoort! Brads [Github](https://github.com/bradtraversy)**

### Built with the MERN (MongoDB Atlas, Express, React, Node.js) Stack

\*\* The Project is missing the Config folder, I removed it and added it to `.gitignore`. The file contained passwords and the JWT secret to hash the password.
you must add it back in under the root directory where the api is stored.
